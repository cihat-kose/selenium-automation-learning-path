2. Locate the test cases in the appropriate directory provided.
3. Run the test cases.
4. Customize the test cases as needed to suit your testing requirements.

## ✨ Features

- Comprehensive Selenium training material.
- Sample test cases and examples.
- Basic HTML tutorials.
- 14-day structured learning plan.

## 📦 Dependencies

- **Java JDK**: 11 or newer (tested on 21.0.6)
- **Selenium WebDriver**: 4.31.0
- **JUnit**: 4.13.1 (comes bundled with Java setup in most IDEs)
- **Commons IO**: 2.11.0
- **SLF4J NOP**: 1.7.30

## 🔧 Configuration

Since there is no `pom.xml` file, ensure you manually add all the necessary dependencies using Maven as described above.

## 📚 Documentation

Each section of this repository is documented to provide clear and concise information on how to effectively use
Selenium for web automation.

## 💡 Examples

Example test cases are located in the provided test directory. These examples demonstrate how to use Selenium WebDriver
for various web automation tasks.

> ℹ️ **Note on wait methods:**  
> In some examples, you might notice the use of static waits (e.g., `MyFunction.wait(5)` or `Thread.sleep()`).  
> These are used only for demonstration and visual confirmation purposes.  
> In real-world automation, always prefer **explicit waits**, such as `WebDriverWait`, for proper synchronization and reliability.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure that Selenium WebDriver is properly installed and operational. Check that extensions and drivers (such as
  ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) are up to date.
- Make sure your Java environment is correctly set up for Selenium and other dependencies.
- Ensure that your IntelliJ IDEA and other development tools are configured according to the project's requirements.
- If you are experiencing issues with dependencies, check your Maven configurations and ensure that the necessary
  libraries are properly included in your project.
- If problems persist, open an issue on the GitHub repository. Try to describe your problem in as much detail as
  possible so that you can receive help more quickly.

If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
